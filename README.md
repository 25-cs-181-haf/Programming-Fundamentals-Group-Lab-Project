Project Title:

Library Management System

Title Explanation:

The Library Management System is a console-based application developed in C++ that helps manage library operations digitally. The title reflects the core purpose of the project: organizing, maintaining, and controlling library data such as books, users, and borrowing records in a systematic and efficient manner.

Problem Statement:

Managing library records manually is time-consuming, error-prone, and inefficient. Libraries require a system to store book details, track issued and returned books, and manage user records accurately. The absence of a centralized system makes data retrieval and updates difficult.
This project aims to solve these problems by developing a C++-based Library Management System that automates record management using CRUD operations through a user-friendly console interface.

Tools and Technologies Used:

Programming Language: C++

Development Environment: Any standard C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, Dev-C++, Code::Blocks, Visual Studio)

Interface: Console-based (Text User Interface)

The project is implemented entirely in C++, following object-oriented programming principles.

Brief Project Description

This project is a Library Management System developed in C++ that allows users to perform essential library operations efficiently. The system supports Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations for managing books, users, and borrowing records.

The application features a menu-driven, user-friendly console interface that enables easy navigation and interaction. It makes extensive use of C++ concepts taught during lab sessions, such as variables, control structures, functions, arrays, file handling, structures/classes, and object-oriented programming.

The project was developed as a group project with a team size ranging from 1 to 3 students, and the codebase contains at least 1000 lines of C++ code, ensuring sufficient complexity and coverage of lab concepts.
